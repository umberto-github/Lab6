# Lab6
Inventory Hub System using Blazor Client and .Net Core WebAPI


# Reflective Summary

## Project's Target
The target of this project is building  and developyng the full-stack Inventory Hub integration project

## Experiences acquired
During this project development , I improved my knowledge in ASP.NET Core, in particular with in-memory cache management and CORS policies.
I also learned how to handle exceptions and JSON deserialization.

## Challenges encountered
One of principal challenges has been to implement an efficiency in-memory cache strategy. 
I had to understand how to manage the memory cache expiration and make sure that the datas was always updated.
Another challenge was been mo handle exceptions during Json deserialization, to ensure that errors was managed in the correct way to the user.

## Project's decisions
I chose to use a in-memory cache to improve the performances and reduce the server payload.
I decided also to develop a CORS policies to allow requests from specific origin, to ensure in same time application security.

## Feedback and future improvements
I received positive feedback on the code structure and on the exception handling.
In future, I'd like to explore others caching tecniques and further optimize the application performance to have smooth application , reliable , scalable and manutenable.
